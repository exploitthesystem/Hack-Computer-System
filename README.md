# Author: Marko Ljubicic

This project was based on the software-hardware interface described in _The Elements of Computing Systems_ by Nisan and Schocken. It implements necessary components for a rudimentary computer called Hack. Supplementary material was found online at the <a href="http://nand2tetris.org" target="_blank">Nand2Tetris</a> == $0 website. Language specifications can be found on the course website.

This repository contains files for the Hack assembler and virtual machine.
